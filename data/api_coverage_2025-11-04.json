This API is for decoding with certain hardware acceleration modes/APIs only.\nThe returned  AVHWFramesContext  is not initialized. The caller must do this with  av_hwframe_ctx_init() .\nCalling this function is not a requirement, but makes it simpler to avoid codec or hardware API specific details when manually allocating frames.\nAlternatively to this, an API user can set  AVCodecContext.hw_device_ctx , which sets up  AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx  fully automatically, and makes it unnecessary to call this function or having to care about  AVHWFramesContext  initialization at all.\nThere are a number of requirements for calling this function:\nIt must be called from get_format with the same avctx parameter that was passed to get_format. Calling it outside of get_format is not allowed, and can trigger undefined behavior. \n The function is not always supported (see description of return values). Even if this function returns successfully, hwaccel initialization could fail later. (The degree to which implementations check whether the stream is actually supported varies. Some do this check only after the user's get_format callback returns.) \n The hw_pix_fmt must be one of the choices suggested by get_format. If the user decides to use a  AVHWFramesContext  prepared with this API function, the user must return the same hw_pix_fmt from get_format. \n The device_ref passed to this function must support the given hw_pix_fmt. \n After calling this API function, it is the user's responsibility to initialize the  AVHWFramesContext  (returned by the out_frames_ref parameter), and to set  AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx  to it. If done, this must be done before returning from get_format (this is implied by the normal  AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx  API rules). \n The  AVHWFramesContext  parameters may change every time time get_format is called. Also,  AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx  is reset before get_format. So you are inherently required to go through this process again on every get_format call. \n It is perfectly possible to call this function without actually using the resulting  AVHWFramesContext . One use-case might be trying to reuse a previously initialized  AVHWFramesContext , and calling this API function only to test whether the required frame parameters have changed. \n Fields that use dynamically allocated values of any kind must not be set by the user unless setting them is explicitly allowed by the documentation. If the user sets  AVHWFramesContext.free  and  AVHWFramesContext.user_opaque , the new free callback must call the potentially set previous free callback. This API call may set any dynamically allocated fields, including the free callback.\nThe function will set at least the following fields on  AVHWFramesContext  (potentially more, depending on hwaccel API):\nAll fields set by  av_hwframe_ctx_alloc() . \n Set the format field to hw_pix_fmt. \n Set the sw_format field to the most suited and most versatile format. (An implication is that this will prefer generic formats over opaque formats with arbitrary restrictions, if possible.) \n Set the width/height fields to the coded frame size, rounded up to the API-specific minimum alignment. \n Only  if  the hwaccel requires a pre-allocated pool: set the initial_pool_size field to the number of maximum reference surfaces possible with the codec, plus 1 surface for the user to work (meaning the user can safely reference at most 1 decoded surface at a time), plus additional buffering introduced by frame threading. If the hwaccel does not require pre-allocation, the field is left to 0, and the decoder will allocate new surfaces on demand during decoding. \n Possibly  AVHWFramesContext.hwctx  fields, depending on the underlying hardware API.\nEssentially, out_frames_ref returns the same as  av_hwframe_ctx_alloc() , but with basic frame parameters set.\nThe function is stateless, and does not change the  AVCodecContext  or the device_ref  AVHWDeviceContext .\navctx \n \n \n The context which is currently calling get_format, and which implicitly contains all state needed for filling the returned  AVHWFramesContext  properly.  \n \n \n \n \n device_ref \n \n \n A reference to the  AVHWDeviceContext  describing the device which will be used by the hardware decoder.  \n \n \n \n \n hw_pix_fmt \n \n \n The hwaccel format you are going to return from get_format.  \n \n \n \n \n out_frames_ref \n \n \n On success, set to a reference to an  uninitialized   AVHWFramesContext , created from the given device_ref. Fields will be set to values required for decoding. Not changed if an error is returned.  \n \n \n \n zero on success, a negative value on error. The following error codes have special semantics:  AVERROR(ENOENT) : the decoder does not support this functionality. Setup is always manual, or it is a decoder which does not support setting  AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx  at all, or it is a software format.  AVERROR(EINVAL) : it is known that hardware decoding is not supported for this configuration, or the device_ref is not supported for the hwaccel referenced by hw_pix_fmt."
